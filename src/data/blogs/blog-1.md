###### Failing has no inherent value, but you must not be afraid of failing, said the Prince.
When Prince Daniel visited Chalmers Ventures to take part in world-improving entrepreneurship, failures were also on the agenda.
The gathering arena Vera's Gr√§smatta was almost packed with people when Prince Daniel and his delegation sat down to listen to pitches from a handful of world-improving startup companies born out of Chalmers, partly to talk about daring to fail.

#### Our mistake
"The day we launched our first product on Kickstarter changed our lives.
With a huge lack of resources, we produced our own video and posted it on Kickstarter and Facebook, (and you won't believe what happened afterwards) what happened afterward could we never have imagined.
After a successful Kickstarter campaign, the video went viral around the world, and we got a shock that we were absolutely not prepared for. "Suddenly it happened".
The video was shared on social media and was shown on many TV channels globally, and received over 100 million views with a budget of around 100 dollars."

The problem was ... we didn't have the most important parts in place.
We had no webshop that people could order from. The media that wrote about us linked to our Kickstarter page, which was already over and linked to our website, which at that time had exactly the same information and referred back to the Kickstarter page... so the visitors were nothing but confused, and we missed out on incredibly many customers.
It didn't hit us to quickly create a webshop because we thought it was too difficult, but knowing the solution now... It's not difficult.
[*sigh*]

We also noticed during and after the viral period that people had a hard time finding us. It turned out that we didn't have a clear mark and link in our video that the viewers could easily follow to us.
And our links in the marketing material were static, not dynamic, which means, as soon as we changed the "name" of something, the link became completely useless.

#### The Learning
The tough mistake taught us an important lesson. Be prepared for the unexpected, and be prepared for changes. We learned to always have a webshop ready, even for pre-ordering, or a way to capture the viewers before launching anything.
We learned to have clear marks and dynamic links in all marketing materials, including videos, which can clearly refer the viewer to a website or goal. The target location must be able to easily guide the visitor to take a step closer to purchasing.
Trying to get a product out on the market quickly is important, but it's even more important to be prepared for what comes after the launch. Be prepared that nothing will go as planned, and much can suddenly happen.

#### Never Dont Give Up
We were young, inexperienced entrepreneurs who never had any startup before and didn't know what we were doing at all. But we decided to jump in the water and learn to swim along the journey. It's been almost two years now, and because of the incredibly many mistakes we've made, and all the generous and helpful people we met, we sit here today ... wiser, just as passionate, and ready to take big leaps forward.
