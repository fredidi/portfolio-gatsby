The media that wrote about us linked to our Kickstarter page, which was already over and linked to our website, which at that time had exactly the same information and referred back to the Kickstarter page... so the visitors were nothing but confused, and we missed out on incredibly many customers.\r\nIt didn't hit us to quickly create a webshop because we thought it was too difficult, but knowing the solution now... It's not difficult.\r\n[<em>sigh</em>]</p>\n<p>We also noticed during and after the viral period that people had a hard time finding us. It turned out that we didn't have a clear mark and link in our video that the viewers could easily follow to us.\r\nAnd our links in the marketing material were static, not dynamic, which means, as soon as we changed the \"name\" of something, the link became completely useless.</p>\n<h4>The Learning</h4>\n<p>The tough mistake taught us an important lesson. Be prepared for the unexpected, and be prepared for changes. We learned to always have a webshop ready, even for pre-ordering, or a way to capture the viewers before launching anything.\r\nWe learned to have clear marks and dynamic links in all marketing materials, including videos, which can clearly refer the viewer to a website or goal. The target location must be able to easily guide the visitor to take a step closer to purchasing.\r\nTrying to get a product out on the market quickly is important, but it's even more important to be prepared for what comes after the launch. Be prepared that nothing will go as planned, and much can suddenly happen.</p>\n<h4>Never Dont Give Up</h4>\n<p>We were young, inexperienced entrepreneurs who never had any startup before and didn't know what we were doing at all. But we decided to jump in the water and learn to swim along the journey. It's been almost two years now, and because of the incredibly many mistakes we've made, and all the generous and helpful people we met, we sit here today ... wiser, just as passionate, and ready to take big leaps forward.
